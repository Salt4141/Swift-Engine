This my attempt at building an engine in Swift. I tried to learn swift before by reading the documentation, but that is way too difficult. So I decided I would make an engine outside of Xcode and with only Cocoa and VSCode. 

Every day I will try update it every day, and look at advice and implement it. Here, I will include both updates of what changes I make every day, and a description of how to use the engine, once it's finished.

Update Log:
Day 1 â€” Today I uploaded the first version. All it is is a window with a background color. Tomorrow expect me to include a button that creates new windows inside the tab group (I might change, but in general expect there to be an update)


Running it:
To compile it, run: swiftc main.swift appDelegate.swift (for now, when you add more files you also have to add them to the compilation)
Then to run it, run: ./main
